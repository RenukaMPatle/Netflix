This project explores Netflix's content strategy by analyzing key data points. The goal is to identify trends in content performance based on timing, genre, and audience engagement. 

**Objective**
The objective of this project is to analyze Netflix’s 2023 content release data to understand the platform’s content strategy. By examining patterns in release timing, content type, language, and viewership, the goal is to uncover how Netflix maximizes audience engagement through strategic planning.

**Description**
This project focuses on a detailed analysis of Netflix content released in 2023, using a dataset that includes information such as title, release date, content type (show or movie), language, availability status, and total viewership hours.

By exploring this data, the project aims to:

1. Identify seasonal trends and high-performing content periods.
2. Understand the impact of release timing (e.g., weekdays, holidays, seasons) on viewership.
3. Compare viewership performance between movies and shows.
4. Highlight how Netflix leverages content variety and timing to capture audience attention.

**Conclusion**
The analysis shows that Netflix strategically times its content releases to maximize viewership, with major spikes around holidays like New Year’s and Valentine’s Day. Shows consistently outperform movies in engagement, and peak viewing periods occur in June, December, and the Fall season. Most releases happen on Fridays, aligning with weekend viewing habits. Rather than focusing on volume, Netflix prioritizes high-impact titles and optimal release timing to drive audience engagement.
